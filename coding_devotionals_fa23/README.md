## Teach on Another

The ability to present a coding technique and empower learners to use that technique is rewarding and is a key part of a programmer's professional life. You can expect to be a teacher/trainer through short impromptu Q&A or more formal training. This challenge provides each of your teams the space to demonstrate this skill as we learn Pyspark, SparkML, Spark SQL, Docker, and Streamlit.

## Challenge

Work with your team to create a training (15-25 minutes) that teaches a specific programming technique from the list above (teams can propose other topics).  The challenge should meet the following criteria.

- Introduce the learning goal and topic area
- provide hands-on programming activities that the learners can use during the training
- provide a more detailed example they can leverage after the training
- document references they can review for further learning

### Scheduling

Each team needs to provide at least two of these trainings during the semester, and they can build on each other. You will get at least a weeks notice of your devotional time.  Please have your teaching topics approved before you start preparing.

### Grading

Each team will be scored with the following metric. Your team's presentation will get a score out of 4.  The quality of your portion will get a score out of 4. Then, your final score will be calculated as `Team Score X .75 + Individual Score X .25`. Finally, the average of your two presentations will represent your final score. 

### Canvas Submission

You will submit your team presentation and a well-documented description of your contribution to the team project in Canvas. 

### GitHub Sharing

Each team will create a folder named to represent their learning topic. The learning materials will be included in that folder.  They should have their pull request submitted at least 24 hours before the class where they will present.  Each student will then use materials from this main repo for the learning.
