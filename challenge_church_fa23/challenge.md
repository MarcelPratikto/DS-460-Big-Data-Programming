# Exploring Data Challenge

For this challenge, we will be comparing church buildings from Utah to the state of Georgia. You will use the Polars package and plotly express to complete the work.

## Data 

Your final code needs to work using the `parquet` folder data.  You can use the other two data folders to explore at first.

## Coding Challenge Questions

__Remember that you are submitting a report that proves to me that you know what is happening with this data. It is a report not a vomit of code with poorly developed visuals.__

_Each question should include 1) a code snippet that demonstrates the wrangling done and the chart created, 2) a visualization, 3) a display of the first five rows of your data used in the display, and 4) A few sentences that describe the insight._

_Complete at least three of the questions below._

1. What differences are there between iPhone and Android users when comparing visits to The Church of Jesus Christ buildings of Latter-day Saints in Utah and Georgia?
2. Compare hourly usage patterns between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the other churches in each state.
3. Contrast the `related_same_day_brand` brands between those who visit the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and those who visit other churches.
4. This is a bit of a reach. Compare `related_same_day_brand` of temples, seminary buildings, and meetinghouses of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
