Multiple industries leverage SafeGraph data to provide value and improve quality in their analytics pipelines ([see examples](https://www.safegraph.com/industries)). As a _Data as a Service (DaaS)_ company, they provide high quality and high volume data representing foot traffic at varied points of interest (POI). Their data are rich in their spatial and temporal detail.

Businesses that want to leverage this type of data need to see the data value. They also want to understand your specific skills at wrangling, feature creation, predictive modeling, and app development using Spark. In addition to your data science development skills, they want to understand your ability to generate value from data.

We need a final predictive model accessible by non-technical employees within the designed use case. Carefully documented guides should support this predictive model, data ingestions, data engineering, application development, and process implementation and installation. 

## Temple and Church Building Prediction Model

We would like you to leverage the SafeGraph data to build a structure for predicting the next US temple locations. We will use 2019 traffic data to identify a model for locating the announced temples from 2020-2023. Our tool should

1. leverage as much Safegraph patterns data as possible,
2. use census data, 
3. predict a probability for each county in the US,
4. identify validating sources to check our data, and
5. use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/price#current)

_Your submission will receive added weight if you exemplify incorporating additional data sets beyond those available from the Class._ __But your team needs to find and parse the data for the class to use.__

## Statement of Work Proposal Guidelines

Your proposal should be no more than two pages and should include the following;

- Team member names and majors
- A proposal of how you will leverage the data to answer the question
- Explanation of the current SafeGraph data format and some descriptive visualizations
- Explanation of the Census data
- Additional data that you will leverage beyond that found in the SafeGraph (if any)
- Description of what constitutes a successfully implemented product
